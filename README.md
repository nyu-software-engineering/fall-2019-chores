# HouseKeeper
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nyu-software-engineering/fall-2019-chores.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/nyu-software-engineering/fall-2019-chores?branch=master)

HouserKeeper is a Progressive Web App designed to help roommates respectfully allocate chores amongst themselves. No one wants to be the "bossy roommate" who tells everyone else what to do; however, when living with others, each roommate needs to contribute in order to ensure that the living space is comfortable for everyone. HouseKeeper aims to eliminate the animosity often created by assigning and enforcing tasks onto others. Using ReactJS and Node.js, we have created a cross-platform solution to help roommates fairly distribute chores.
