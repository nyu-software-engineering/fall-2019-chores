  "description": "- Grocery Assistant is an application that allows users to order groceries via Whole Foods (if said user lives within a Whole Foods delivery radius) through a simple text-messaging interface. In addition to placing orders as the user sees fit, it also includes the option of storing items in a cart that is internal to the app until said cart accumulates a certain subtotal. This feature is especially useful for [Amazon Prime Now](https://primenow.amazon.com/), as users are able to get free shipping on orders exceeding $35. However, as a user might not have $35 of items to add at once, the application-side cart allows the user to accumulate items that will be ordered on a later date, or automatically if the cart's subtotal exceeds some user's pre-defined threshold to do so.",
