# HouseKeeper - Contributing

These guidelines are subject to change as we are continuously adding to this project.

Contribution to this project is limited to the core team members.

## Git workflow
1. Create a new branch from the dev branch for each task
2. If work on the branch is not completed within 24 hours, rebase from the dev branch to stay updated
3. When the task is completed, rebase from dev branch and fix any incompatibilities
4. Do a pull request to merge into the dev branch
5. Have someone review your code for correctness and style
6. If there are any issues, correct them and go back to step 4
7. Have the reviewing member accept the pull request
8. Toward the end of a sprint, focus more on resolving bugs than on new features
9. At the end of a sprint, barring any major bugs, merge the dev branch into master
10. Create a new dev branch from master
